The aim of the project is to create real estate price prediction model
In other words, the project aims to build a program in which user can add parameters from an advertisement they are interested in. As a result, they will receive feedback regarding the valuation of the offer (whether the offer is priced appropriately compared to similar ones, or if it is underpriced or overpriced). The application also aims to display the forecasted 'appropriate' price of the offer if it is not already so.

The motivation for undertaking the project is the desire to expand the range of tools that help in selecting the right offers on the real estate market, increasing awareness of the current state of the market, and the most important factors affecting the price of an apartment.

Files marked with numbers 1-8 at the beginning of their names indicate the order of project development.

To implement your own apartment data to receive a price prediction, you need to edit the penultimate code cell in the file marked with the number 8.
