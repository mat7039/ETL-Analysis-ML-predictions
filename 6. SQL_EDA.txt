--Summary: The most expensive apartments are not necessarily the largest in terms of area, but they are certainly above average in size. On average, move-in-ready apartments are 1700 PLN more expensive per square meter than those needing renovation. The average price per square meter is nearly 3000 PLN higher for secondary market properties, although popularity (in terms of the number of listing upvotes) is identical between secondary and primary markets. The highest price per square meter is found in historic tenements, which is also supported by the fact that more expensive apartments are in buildings from 1930 or earlier (old tenements after renovation). There is no noticeable price difference per square meter among materials, though reinforced concrete buildings are the most expensive. The average construction year for the most popular listings is 1972, suggesting that people are more likely to search for older buildings (e.g., tenements) despite their generally higher prices. The most expensive apartments are in Sopot, followed by Gdynia, with slightly cheaper apartments in Gdańsk. In the dataset, the highest price per square meter is found in districts in the following order: Grunwaldzka (Sopot), Śródmieście (Gdańsk), and Dolny Sopot. The cheapest districts are: Ujeścisko-Łostowice, Dąbrowa, and Łostowice. By far, the largest apartments are in Sopot (which may correlate with the highest apartment prices and the highest price per square meter in old tenements). In districts with a large number of apartments for sale, new development projects are likely being sold. Extreme price districts (both the cheapest and the most expensive per square meter) may enjoy greater popularity in terms of sales listings. Despite price differences, the secondary market enjoys the same level of popularity (number of listing upvotes) as the primary market.
